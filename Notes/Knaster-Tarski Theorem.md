#  Knaster-Tarski Theorem
---
>[!Theorem] 
>Let $(L, \le)$ be a [[Complete Lattice]] and $f : L \to L$ be a monotonous function, then the set of fixed points of $f$ also form a complete lattice under $\le$.

>[!note] Existence of a fixed point.
>Consider the set of fixed points, empty set is a subset, even if the set-itself is emtpy. And that set must have an infemum, hence an infemum must exist.

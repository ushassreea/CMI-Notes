# Sub-Games
---
>[!definition]
>Let $V$ be the arena of a game $G$, and $U \subseteq V$ then $G[U] = \langle A|_U, \chi|_{U}\rangle$ is a sub-game of $G$ if every dead end in $G[U]$ is a dead end in $G$.

## Some Properties
- For every $\sigma$-trap $u$ in $G$, $G[u]$ is a sub-game of $G$.
- For every family $\{ U_{i} \}_{i \in I}$ for $\sigma-$ tuple $U_i$, then $\bigcup_{i \in I} U_{i}$ is a $\sigma$-trap as well.
- If $X$ is a $\sigma$-trap in $G$ and $Y\subseteq X$ then $Y$ is a $\sigma$-trap in $G$ iff $Y$ is a $\sigma$-trap in $X$

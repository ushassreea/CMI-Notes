# Winning Arena for Parity Games

>[!tldr] Goal

>This strategy fails because consider a situation where we consider visit a set $G$ again and again, and visit $B$ only finitely many times. It might be that if we want to visit $G$ infinitely many times, all paths would go though $B$, but at the same time, it might be possible to completely avoid $B$ if we don't care about visiting $G$ infinitely often.

## Stealing the Rabin Game Strategy
The Parity can be very easily be converted to a Rabin game as follows.
For each $n$
- let $G_n$ be the set of all vertices that have the colour $2n$
- let $B_n$ be the set of all vertices that have a colour of odd parity of size less than $2n$

Now we just use the strategy described in [[Winning Arena for Rabin Games]].

## Proof that Parity Games are Determined
>[!tldr] Plan
>Consider the largest 1-paradise, and show that it's complement is a 0-paradise

Let $X^1_{i}$ be a $1$-paradise and consider all let $X^1 = \bigcup_{i\in I}$ be the union of all $1$-paradises which is the largest $1$-paradise.

But since $\text{attr}_0(X^1) \supseteq X^1$ and $\text{attr}_0(X^1)$ is a $1$-paradise, $X^1$ is its attractor, so the complement of $X^1$ is a $1$-trap.

We now restrict the game to the trap defined above. In that sub-game let $S_0$ be the set of points that have the colour $0$. 

Now we consider the part of the sub-game that is the complement of $\text{attr}_0(S_{0})$ which is a $0-$trap. Now in that sub-sub-game the number of colours used are significantly less, so by induction we can show that there is a partition sub-sub-game which are $0$ and $1$ paradises.

- In the sub-sub-game, the player $1$ paradise gives a winning strategy for player 1, which will word as long as player $0$ does not move the game to the set $X^1$ from which player $1$ also has a winning strategy, therefore the entire arena of the sub-sub-game is a $0$-paradise.
- The $0$-paradise gives a strategy for player $0$ that can be used as long as player $1$ does not go out of the sub-sub-game to the set $attr_0(S_{0})$. But if player 1 does that, player $0$ can then visit a node with value $0$ and after that either stay in the attractor or go back to the sub-sub-game. $(X^1)^c$ is a $0$-attractor.

## Complexity of existence of a winning strategy in a finite-arena parity game.
>[!question] Problem
>Given a parity game $G$ and a vertex $v$ from the vertex set of $G$, can player $0$ force a victory.

>[!note] Complexity
>The problem is in [[NP (Complexity Class)|NP]] $\cap$ [[Co-NP (Complexity Class)|Co-NP]].
>This means that its highly unlikely that the problem is [[NP Complete]], but there is no known algorithm in [[P Complexity Class|P]] for the problem.

### NP Algorithm
>[!idea]
The Idea is to guess a strategy and to check if the strategy is winning in polynomial time.

We represent selecting a strategy by removing every outgoing edge from every $v\in V_0$ except for the one picked by the strategy, so our algorithm becomes as follows:
- We go to the description of each $v\in V_0$ and we remove all outgoing edges except for one that is picked that the strategy that was decided non-deterministically.
- In the reduced graph we now check that the strategy is correct by checking if there exists and odd-cycle in the same weakly-connected component as $v$.
	- This is done by doing a DFA from each vertex checking if there is a path from each vertex $v \in  V_1$ that comes back to $v$ and doesn't go over a vertex that has index less than that of $v$. 
	- This is used to detect a cycle with $v$ as the element with colour of least index. If we find one, then we halt the machine rejecting the input. otherwise we accept.

### Co-NP Algorithm.
Since the game is a zero-sum game without draws, if player $0$ cannot win, then player $1$ must be able to win. Hence, checking if player $0$ cannot win is the same as checking if player 1 can win. 

We use the same algorithm discussed in the previous section by modifying to so it checks if player 1 can win.

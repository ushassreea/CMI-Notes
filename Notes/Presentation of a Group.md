# Presentation of a Group
---
A *presentation* is a way to represent a graph.

It comprises of a set of generators $S$ and a set of relations $R$ among the generators and we write it as follows
$$
G = \langle S | R \rangle
$$
This means that $G$ is in some sense the *"free-est"* group that follows the set of relations $R$.

>[!definition] Formal formal
>Formally there are two ways to interpret the above statement.
>- The easy way : It is a quotient on the free group generated by $S$ quotiented by the free group generated by $R$.

>[!example] 
>- The group $\langle \{ a, b \} |\rangle$ is the free group of rank 2
>- The group $\langle \{ a, b | ab = ba \}\rangle$. This is the free abelian group of rank 2.

>[!lemma] $T_M$  is a good subgroup of $G$

^17831a

We already have 
$$
\phi_{i}(T_{M}\cap G_{a_{i}b_{i}}^{MM}) = \phi(T_{M}) \cap \phi(G_{a_{i},b_{i}}^{MM}) = \phi(T_{M}) \cap G_{c_{i}0}^{M^21}
$$

But since any transition done on $T_m$ remains inside $T_m$ we have $\phi(T_M)\subseteq T_{M}$ and any transition to elements of $T_m$ are from elements in $T_M$ therefore the inverse image of $\phi$ is also in $T_M$ therefore $\phi(T_{m}) \supseteq T_{M}$. Thus we have $\phi(T_M)= T_M$

Hence $T_M$ is a good subgroup.

A *free group* in a [[Groups|group]] with the least structure in some sense of the word structure. 

>[!definition]
>Over a set $S$, the free group $F_S$ is the set of all words that can be built from the members of $S$, considering two words to be different unless their equality follows from the Group Axioms.
>Here the members of $S$ are called the generators and $|S|$ is called the rank of the free group
>

## Universal Property 
The free group $F_S$ is the universal group generated by the set $S$. This can be formalised by the following universal property:

>[!tip] Universal Property of Free Groups
>Given a function $f$ from $S$ to a group $G$, there exists a unique homomorphism $\varphi$ from $F_S$ to $G$ such that the following diagram commutes
